EAT LIKE A WARRIOR

Step 1: Cut The Crap.

Your goal here is to lose body fat, increase overall health, and boost energy (and overall physical output).

    - Candy, cookies, sodas, junk food, fast food and booze are not for warriors.
    - Crap is NOT okay "in moderation.
    - "Food" is NOT defined as anything you can swallow that won't kill you immediately.
    - Consuming "obvious crap" is either taking a step backward or temporarily halting your progress.
    - You are not entitled to any reward for anything ever. This goes for food as well.
    - Dessert OR Booze once a week ONLY (including social events.) YOU ARE IN TRAINING.

Step 2:Limit the Fat sQUAD

These are foods often considered to be healthy that really arent.

    - Natural Sugar (Cane, brown, organic white, etc.)
    - Wheat
    - Milk
    - Pasteurized Fruit juice

Studies conclusively shown that polypeptides from these foods bind to your brain's morphine receptor, the same receptor to which opiate drugs bind, meaning that you get cravings, overeat, and disrupt your natural appetite signaling mechanisms.

It can take anywhere from 5 to 28 days to drop the "addiction" to these foods. 

IT WILL NOT BE EASY (which is exactly why it works!)

Step 3: Replace all the above with choices befitting a warrior.

    - Replace your breads, cereals, and pastas with rice, potatoes, quinoa, oatmeal, buckwheat, and starchy vegetables.
    - Replace your milk (coffee and tea only) with organic heavy cream.
    - Replace your juice with A) water B) fresh whole fruit C) fresh squeezed (if wanted).
    - Replace eating out with foods you cook yourself as much as possible. (Save big $$$)

Step 4: 16/8 INTERMITTENT FASTING

WEIGHT & FAT MANAGEMENT:

The practice of 16/8 intermittent fasting (that is eating for an 8 hour window followed by 16 hours of non-eating) has conclusively shown to lead to significant increases in metabolic changes in the body (by up to 14 percent according to the latest studies) and maintain lean muscle tissue as much as possible.

These changes typically start about three to five hours after eating, when the body enters a post-absorptive state rather than the state of ongoing digestion, where eating either frequent small or infrequent large meals means the body is always involved in some digestive activity. 

LONGEVITY: Intermittent fasting has shown to slow down the development of death related health disorders. According to the head of the National Institute on Agings neuroscience laboratory - The moderate stress that intermittent fasting puts on the body presents a constant threat increasing the bodys dominant cellular defenses against potential molecular destruction  

Intermittent fasting spurs the body to sustain and repair tissues keeping every organ and cell functioning efficiently (including skin, hair, nails, etc.) - thus creating a significant, consistent, and almost passive anti-aging state of well being.

MENTAL WELL-BEING: Every religion around the world practices fasting at some point in time during the year its no surprise, then, that a lifestyle that includes intermittent fasting leads to an increased sense of spirituality, mental clarity, and intrinsic discipline.

WOTW students who integrate intermittent fasting all reported feeling at peace during their fasts, and studies have proven that 16/8 intermittent fasting helps regulate mood by decreasing levels of adrenaline, cortisol, and norepinephrine (the chemicals that stimulate anxiety and stress.)

RECAP:

1. Fast for around 16 hours, a little more is ok too. 

2. Start the fast after your last evening meal. For example. You eat your last meal 3 hours before bed at 7:00 pm. Go to sleep at 10:00 pm, and rise at 6:00 am. You enjoy a cup of coffee/tea (or two) in the morning and go about your daily life until around midday. 

3. After a few days adjusting to this, you're likely to feel super motivated and productive during this time, so make the most of it. 

Also, your energy levels should begin to stabilize as you move away from that ultra high carb lifestyle of cereal for breakfast, toast, and sweet snacks during the day.

4. Lunch around noon, comprising of a nice clean protein source, some salad or vegetables, and perhaps some complex carbs to help fuel your day.

Eat when you feel hungry until 8:00 pm.

5. Eat mostly minimal processed whole foods. Meats, vegetables, eggs, fish, salads, good fat sources. Each meal will consist of some fish, meat, eggs, or some other proper protein source, vegetables, and some complex carbs (as we previously discussed) to fuel activity as required.

This method of eating is not just about weight loss at any cost; its about re-evaluating what real food is, and implementing a PROVEN and pretty non-controversial lifestyle to help you get RIDICULOUSLY healthy, limit stress, increase energy and overall output.

    - This is a lifestyle change and not a temporary fix. 
    - Much more sustainable than ANY OTHER diets. 
    - The practice is a valuable, and reliable tool for weight loss, ongoing weight maintenance, self discipline, and mental tenacity.

Thats it! Go forth and eat like a WARRIOR!

ABOUT NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS: 

    - Realize most are absolute crap
    - Solid food choices deliver all the vitamins and minerals you need
